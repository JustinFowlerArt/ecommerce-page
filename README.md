## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - State Management
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - UI Components and Styling

### What I learned

My goal for this project was a take a realistic project and use it to learn both Material UI and Redux Toolkit. I learned a great deal about both in my implementation of this e-commerce app, including theme customizations, styled components, and Redux data flow.

### Useful resources
